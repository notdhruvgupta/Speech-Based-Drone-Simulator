# 🗣️ Speech-Based Drone Simulator 🚁

A web-based interactive simulator that demonstrates speech-controlled autonomous drone navigation. This project showcases the integration of voice recognition, 3D drone visualization, and simulated flight paths—allowing users to control a virtual drone using natural voice commands.

## 🌟 Features

- 🎙️ Voice-controlled drone commands (e.g., "take off", "move forward", "land")
- 🌐 3D environment using Three.js
- 🔊 Real-time speech recognition with Web Speech API
- 🧭 Simulated drone flight path visualization
- 📱 Responsive UI for both desktop and mobile

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Three.js** – 3D graphics rendering
- **Web Speech API** – Voice command recognition
- **JavaScript / HTML / CSS** – Core web technologies
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling framework

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Speech-Based-Drone-Simulator.git
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser (no server setup required).

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Educational demonstration of speech and drone tech
- Voice interface prototyping for UAVs
- Web-based simulation platform
